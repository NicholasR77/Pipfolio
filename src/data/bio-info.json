        "If you didn't already catch, my name is Nicholas Robbins. I'm from Phoenix, Arizona and I've lived here pretty much my whole life. I love programming, gaming, woodworking, music, basketball, and travelling. I was recently married to my college sweetheart, Amber, and together we have two dogs, Waffles and jax, and one bunny.",
        "I graduated from Arizona State University with a Bachelor's Degree in Technological Enterprenuership and Management. I know. It's a mouthful. Its essentially just a focus on startups, small businesses, and the future of technology.",
        "While I was in college, I started to learn to program basic Wordpress websites. From that point, I was absolutely hooked. I ended up getting a part time job as a frontend developer for a small web design firm in Scottsdale, Arizona.",
        "After college, I figured I would try to jump into the business world and use my degree, stepping away from my love of programming. After I landed my job at Roll20 though, I know I needed to come back to where my true passion lie. To catch up from my years off from professional programming, I joined the Computer Software Engineering at Flatiron Schools bootcamp where I learned Ruby, Sinatra, Rails, React, and much more. When I graduated Flatiron, Roll20 offered me a position as a Junior Software Developer and I accepted it with eager anticipation at jumping back into the career I love."
